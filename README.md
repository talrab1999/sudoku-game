## Sudoku Game - Final Project (C Course)

This is a Sudoku game I developed as the final project for my C programming course in college.


# Game Features:
At the start, players choose the number of participants and enter their names.
The game automatically selects a square for each player using an algorithm that prioritizes squares with the fewest possible values.
Players are shown the possible numbers they can place in their assigned square.
The game progresses in rounds, with each player taking one turn per round.
The turn order is determined by the initial number of open squares:
The player with the fewest open squares starts first.
The player with the most open squares goes last.
